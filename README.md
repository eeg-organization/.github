# ✌️ Automated Depression Detection System ✌️

## Hey there! 👋

Welcome to the **Automated Depression Detection System** repository! We're a bunch of engineering grads with a kickass project funded by the Ministry of MSME Govt. of India. Our mission? Building a super cool system that can automatically detect depression using EEG signals. 🧠

## What Makes Our System Awesome? 🤩

- **Detect Depression Like a Boss:** Our system uses those brain waves (EEG signals) to automatically spot depression in a jiffy. It's like having a mental health superhero on your side! 💪

- **Crazy Smart Data Analysis:** We've got some genius-level algorithms that can analyze medical data like nobody's business. Our researchers and faculties have put their big brains together to make sure we're nailing those diagnoses with pinpoint accuracy. 🔬

- **Unleash the Knowledge Beast:** We've teamed up with CIP Ranchi to integrate a digital library that's packed with the latest research and mind-blowing information. So, you'll never be behind the curve when it comes to interpreting medical data and staying up-to-date. 📚🔍

## Meet the Dream Team 🚀

We're not your average engineering nerds. We've got an A-team of students from all walks of life. We've got computer science wizards, electronics gurus, hackathon champions, FAANG interns, and even some genius-level researchers. Together, we're on a mission to change the world and make mental health a top priority! 🌟

## Repo Organization 📂

You're probably wondering where all the magic happens. Well, we've got private repositories hidden away in this GitHub organization. Only the chosen ones (aka authorized team members and collaborators) get access to the secret sauce. But hey, if you're interested, give us a shout, and we'll see what we can do! 😉

## Get in on the Action! 🚀
